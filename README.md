# Ride Share Application
Update: I am unable to fork or share the repository since it's private. I'm unable to change these settings as a member of the organization (CS 3240: Advanced Software Development at the University of Virginia) under which this repo belongs. As a workaround, I've shared a screenshot below of my contributions relative to those of my teammates. Credit belongs to Dan Perkins, Will Lampert, Dong Lee, and Eric Armstrong.

NOTE: Due to the inability to fork the original repository, teammate contributions were not preserved when uploading the project manually. Working on a solution to obtain teammate contribution history. Credit belongs to the teammates listed below in addition to myself.

NOTE: Originally hosted for free on Heroku, the below link no longer works following the removal of Heroku's free tier. Working on a solution to this.
### You can view this application on our [Heroku Site](https://ride-share-103.herokuapp.com/).

## Basic Use
### Login
Login to the application using your UVA email address. You will be redirected to a google site. Upon a successful validation of your @virginia.edu email address, you will then be able to use the application to create, and join rides. You are free to browse the rides before logging into an account. If you login to the app and you aren't redirected to the google site, it is likely that you have logged on recently and your information is saved!

### Create a Ride
In order to post your ride to the web page, you go to the "Create Rides" tab and fill out the appropriate information. You will have to provide the appropriate data entry to each field. For example, you need to put in a date for the day of the ride. After the information is filled into you liking, you can then submit the ride and it will be added to the main feed.

### Browsing Rides
In order to see rides that are currently available, you can visit the "Home" page, which allows you to view the rides and search based on criteria. When searching for a ride, you can search for the city destination or origin. Once you have found a ride that you want to see more information about, you can click on the ride to expand the view.

### Joining Rides
Once you have selected a ride that you want to join, you can click on the button that says "Join Ride" while you are viewing the detail page of the ride. Now the ride will show up in your "My Account" page and your name will be listed on the rider list. Keep in mind that you can only join rides created by other users, and you cannot join a ride more than once. 

### Leaving Rides
If you determine that you no longer want to be on this ride, then you can click on the "Leave Ride" button, which will allow you to no longer be on the ride.

### Account Management
In order to view or alter your account, you can visit the "My Account" tab, which allows you to view your account information. You can update the information belonging to your profile as well as view the rides you have joined and created.
